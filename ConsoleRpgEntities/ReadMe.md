I did all of the basic requirements.
	Adding a new character
	Editing a character
	Displaying a character
	Searching for a character
	Logging the interactions

I did most of the C level
	Adding abilities to a character
	Displaying character abilities
	
	I did the code for executing an ability during an attack, but the rooms are messed up as I explained in the video, 
	so there arent monsers in the rooms to show off that the attack works, but the functionality is there if you want to look at it. (In GameEngine)

I did most of the B level
	Adding a new room
	Displaying details for a room
	
	Navigating the rooms is messed up, I dont really know why. I think I linked the rooms together properly. I tried to incorporate the map from the
	midterm, but I think that was messing me up more, and it didnt really turn out.

I didnt do any A level

I tried to do the map from the midterm for the A+. I dont really know if that would count since it was already in the midterm, but it didnt work anyways.



I think my grade should be somewhere around a C and B. I have most of the B, but the navigating the rooms is messed up.
